This repository contains scripts written in R used for performing data analysis and generating figures for the manuscript:

Xu X, Stoyanova EI, Lemiesz A, Xing J, Mash DC, Heintz N (2018). Species and Cell-Type Properties of Classically Defined Human and Rodent Neurons and Glia.

All data files are provided except for human and mouse genome fasta files which can be downloaded from ENSEMBL (Release 88 was used for paper) and GSE97930_CerebellarHem_snDrop-seq_UMI_Count_Matrix_08-01-2017.txt, which can be downloaded from GEO (GSE97930) (unzip before use).

ATAC_processing.rmd and ATAC_analysis.rmd contain some linux commands for processing ATAC-seq files.
